2.Orbital transformation (03, 08 JCP, test model, DNA in water (10000+atoms))
DIIS (1982 JCC)
Advantages: It's fast, because no expensive diagonalisation is performed. If preconditioned correctly, method guaranteed to find minimum. 
Disadvantages: Sensitive to preconditioning. A good preconditioner can be expensive. No smearing, or advanced SCF mixing possible: 
POOR convergence for metalic systems.

3.density matrix extrapolation
PS and ASPC are recommended. Order for the PS or ASPC extrapolation (typically 2-4). 
Higher order might bring more accuracy, but comes, for large systems, also at some cost. 
In some cases, a high order extrapolation is not stable, and the order needs to be reduced.

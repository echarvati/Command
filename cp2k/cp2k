2.Orbital transformation (03, 08 JCP)

Advantages: It's fast, because no expensive diagonalisation is performed. If preconditioned correctly, method guaranteed to find minimum. 
Disadvantages: Sensitive to preconditioning. A good preconditioner can be expensive. No smearing, or advanced SCF mixing possible: 
POOR convergence for metalic systems.
